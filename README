Three tables constitutes this database with the relations, {(sID -> FN, LN, Degree), 
(ISNB-> name, year, numCopies), (sID, bookIssued -> issueDate, dueDate}

Everything is able to be done through the text-based user interface. To run the
application, simply invoke the backend class. This is my driver class which my 
ModelView class utilizes in order to complete its tasks.

I created this application with an SSH tunnel and port forwarding so that updates
can be done no matter what network the user is on.

The usernames and passwords are easily visible in the source code so I won't post
that redundant (AND SENSITIVE) info here.
